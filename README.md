# ASP.NET Core Skeleton üíÄ

#### A simple ASP.NET Core bootstrap template with: 

- Entity Framework Core
- AutoMapper
- Simple Cookie Authentication
- Bootstrap 4.x
- ASP.NET Core ViewComponents usage examples
- Nice folder structure

#### Planning to add:

- Babel (ES6) config through [Brunch](http://brunch.io/)
- [StimulusJs](https://stimulusjs.org/)
- Localization
- FluentValidations
- MediatR (CQRS)

#### What this project IS and IS NOT:

- ‚ùå A structure for a conventional DDD application
- ‚úîÔ∏è An opionated structure that simplifies project bootstrapping
- ‚ùå An architecture based on default standards and common "good practices" (not necessarily though)
- ‚úîÔ∏è A battle tested toolset for small/medium projects focusing on developer productivity


> ‚ÑπÔ∏è The ideia behind this project is not having something set in stone. Unlike this, I'm constantly changing and adapting things around here in a way that can improve productivity (less code = less bugs). 
So, feel free to give it a try and share your thoughts. Any contributions are be welcome.
